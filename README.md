# Dotfiles

Most of the modules here are intended to be linked with `stow` as in `stow -t ~/ $MODNAME` where `$MODNAME` is:
- aws
- dev
- linux
- python
- sync
- term

Where the package contents are hopefully obvious. 

The `old` dir serves as an archive and the `scripts` dir needs to be linked separately by the script it contains.
